This repository consists of a custom model used for Speech Emotion Recognition

Speech Emotion Recognition(SER) is a task of speech processing and computational paralinguistics that aims to recognize and categorize the emotions expressed in spoken language. The goal is to determine a speaker's emotional state, such as happiness, anger, sadness, or frustration, from their speech patterns, such as prosody, pitch, and rhythm.
